    <!-- each setting can have the following fields:

            channel: <channel name>
            command: <command name>
            person: <person nick>
            access: <public or private>
            action: <deny or allow>
            msg: <message to send in response>

         the only field that is requires is the action field. the rest have
         default values that allow them to be applied to the acl structure.
         for instance, if no channel is specified, the rule applies to all
         channels.  if no command is specified, the rule applies to all 
         commands.  if no person is specified, the rule applies to all nicks.
         if no access is specified, the rule applies to both public and private
         messages.  if no msg is specified no msg will be sent in response.

         the fields channel, command, and person can all have a single value
         or a array of values, thus allowing you to apply a rule to multiple
         channels/commands/persons at the same time.

         rules are processed in order with later rules overriding earlier
         rules.  it is best to start with generic rules and then gradually
         get more and more specific.

         all rule definitions are stored as map.  you can include rules from
         another acl file by adding a string to the rules array in the right
         place with the value being the name of the other acl file to include.
