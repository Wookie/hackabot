also left a button on the bureau, um I'm not sure what it goes to but um I, I 
can never bring myself to throw a button away, I know as soon as I do, I'll find
the garment it goes to and then it'll, wait a minute actually could it have been
from the sweater? Did that sweater have buttons? Hmm. Well I should wrap this up
