Hackabot -- A crazy, hackable, and hacked up IRC bot

ABOUT

This bot was mainly written by Michael Marineau and includes many contributions
from other people including various staff of the OSU Open Source Lab. See
the CREDITS file for individual contributors. This bot is more widely known
as 'manatee' on Freenode. At the time of writing I think there is only one
other user of this code. :-)

The core bot is a fairly minimal python program (hackabot.py) which calls
external programs/scripts in commands/ or hooks/<type>/ to do various things.
The core bot interacts with the program via a simple text api over stdin and
stdout. The programs use stderr for for error messages and debug statements.

Hackabot tends to change quite a bit. Although the api tends to be very stable
so existing command are easy to maintain, new commands are constantly being
added and the SQL db schemas tend to change. This unfortunatly makes it
difficult to maintain instances of hackabot other than 'manatee' while trying
to keep up with this code base. Maybe some day there will be proper releases
with upgrade scritps to solve this.

INSTALL

I recomend pinging me before you try to setup hackabot. I tend to forget
to update the included mysql schema dump. :-P

An example config is in etc/hackabot.example.xml for the bot itself and 
most commands. Access control lists are in etc/acl.example.xml (copy to 
acl.xml). Refer to the examples for more information. Command specific
config options are of course optional if you don't plan on using that
particular command (or hook).


RUNNING

Once you have a configured hackabot.xml with nick, server, and what ever else:
./hackabot.py etc/hackabot.xml
and poof! It's a bot!
